          I created this recipe looking for a bread alternative not using any
          grains, processed sugar and processed oils. It is sitting between
          bread and cake feel and my wife loved it. I used pasture-raised eggs
          to my recipe, just because it is more nutritious. But regular eggs
          should be fine.

        <h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>6 Medium Eggs (or 5 Extra Large)</li>
          <li>1 Tbsp Coconut Oil</li>
          <li>¬æ cup Coconut Flour</li>
          <li>1 tsp Baking Powder</li>
          <li>Pinch of Salt</li>
          <li>
            ¬Ω tsp or less of Xanthan Gum (optional, to have a more stick bread)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="directions">Directions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Mix all dry ingredients in a big bowl.</li>
          <li>Add the whole eggs and the coconut oil.</li>
          <li>
            Mix well with a spoon until it gets thick. You can add extra coconut
            flour if you feel it is too liquid.
          </li>
          <li>Pre-heat your oven to 350¬∞F (175¬∞C).</li>
          <li>
            Pour the dough evenly into a Bread/Loaf form (coated with butter or
            parchment paper) and cook for 35 to 45 min.
          </li>
          <li>
            After cooking, remove it from the oven and let it sits while it
            cools down.
          </li>
          <li>
            Some variations can be done, like using butter instead of coconut
            oil or adding pumpkin pure to the mix and having a cake-like
            texture.
